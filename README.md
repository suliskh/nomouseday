Use the Web without a mouse, test the keyboard-support.  No Mouse Day is an extension designed to help you explore and improve keyboard navigation on websites. By temporarily hiding the mouse pointer, it encourages you to rely on your keyboard, raising awareness about web accessibility and making sure everyone can use your website easily.
